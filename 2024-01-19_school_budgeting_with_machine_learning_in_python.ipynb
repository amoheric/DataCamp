    "# Course Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science isn't just for predicting ad-clicks-it's also useful for social impact! This course is a case study from a machine learning competition on DrivenData. You'll explore a problem related to school district budgeting. By building a model to automatically classify items in a school's budget, it makes it easier and faster for schools to compare their spending with other schools. In this course, you'll begin by building a baseline model that is a simple, first-pass approach. In particular, you'll do some natural language processing to prepare the budgets for modeling. Next, you'll have the opportunity to try your own techniques and see how they compare to participants from the competition. Finally, you'll see how the winner was able to combine a number of expert techniques to build the most accurate model."

    "\n",
    "2. **The pipeline workflow**: The supervised learning course introduced pipelines, which are a repeatable way to go from raw data to a trained machine learning model. The scikit-learn Pipeline object takes a sequential list of steps where the output of one step is the input to the next. Each step is represented with a name for the step, that is simply a string, and an object that implements the fit and the transform methods. A good example is the `CountVectorizer` that we used earlier. As we'll see Pipelines are a very flexible way to represent your workflow. In fact, you can even have a sub-pipeline as one of the steps! The beauty of the Pipeline is that it encapsulates every transformation from raw data to a trained model.\n",

Although we don't need a pipeline for a single step, this exercise will get us familiar with the syntax. Remember, we create a Pipeline by passing it a series of named steps. In this case the name is the string 'clf', and the step is the one-vs-rest logistic regression classifier we created earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Train and test with sample numeric data**: The sample dataset we've been working with has numeric data in the numeric columns and the with missing column. We'll start by building a model to predict the label column with the numeric data.\n",

    "5. **Train and test with sample numeric data**: First, we'll use the train_test split function from sklearn dot model_selection. Our X will just be the numeric column, and our Y will be the dummy encoding of the label column. We'll call the fit method on our Pipeline, just like a normal classifier in sklearn. We can see that it returns a Pipeline that has one step to do our logistic regression.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Preprocessing text features**: Our sample dataframe contains one column we haven't used yet, the text column. First, we'll change our train and test data just to be working with the text data for now. Then, we'll add a step to our Pipeline with the name vec and the CountVectorizer object from scikit-learn. Now our pipeline will use the CountVectorizer on our dataset, and then it will pass the result into our classifier.\n",

    "accuracy = pl.score(X_test, y_test)\n",
    "print('accuracy on sample data: ', accuracy)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Preprocessing multiple dtypes**: Let's say we want to use all of our data in a single pipeline. We can't just have a Pipeline that has a `CountVectorizer` step, Imputation step, and then a classifier. The `CountVectorizer` won't know what to do with the numeric columns, and we don't want to perform imputation on the text columns. In order to build our pipeline, we need to separately operate on the text columns and on the numeric columns. There are two tools: FunctionTransformer and FeatureUnion that will help us build a Pipeline to work with both our text and numeric data. The first utility that we cover is the FunctionTransformer.\n",
    "- Want to use all available features in one pipeline\n",
    "- Problem\n",
    "  - Pipeline steps for numeric and text preprocessing can't follow each other\n",
    "  - e.g., output of `CountVectorizer` can't be input to `Imputer`\n",
    "- Solution\n",
    "  - `FunctionTransformer()` & `FeatureUnion()`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **FunctionTransformer**: `FunctionTransformer` has a simple job: take a Python function, and turn it into an object that the scikit-learn Pipeline can understand. We'll write two simple functions: one that takes the whole dataframe, and returns just the numeric columns. The other will take the whole dataframe and return just the text columns. Using these function transformers, we can build a separate Pipeline for our numeric data and for our text data.\n",

    "  - Take entire DataFrame, return text columns\n",
    "- Can then preprocess numeric and text data in separate pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Putting it all together**: First, we'll do our train_test split on the entire dataset and import the FunctionTransformer and FeatureUnion utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(sample_df[['numeric','with_missing', 'text']], pd.get_dummies(sample_df['label']), random_state=2)\n",
    "\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import FunctionTransformer\n",
    "from sklearn.pipeline import FeatureUnion\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Putting it all together**: Next, we'll create two `FunctionTransformer` objects. The first takes a dataframe and just returns the column named 'text'. The second takes a dataframe and returns the columns named 'numeric' and 'with_missing'. These two function transformer objects will let us set up separate Pipelines that operate on the selected columns only. Note that we've passed the parameter validate equals False. This simply tells scikit-learn it doesn't need to check for NaNs or validate the dtypes of the input. We'll do that work ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "get_text_data = FunctionTransformer(lambda x: x['text'], validate=False)\n",
    "get_numeric_data = FunctionTransformer(lambda x: x[['numeric', 'with_missing']], validate=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **FeatureUnion Text and Numeric Features**: `FeatureUnion` from the sklearn dot pipeline module is the other utility we need. We know that our text pipeline generates the array on the left, our text features.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **FeatureUnion Text and Numeric Features**: And our numeric pipeline generates the array on the right, our numeric features.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **FeatureUnion Text and Numeric Features**: The FeatureUnion object puts these two sets of features together as a single array that will be the input to our classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.pipeline import FeatureUnion\n",
    "union = FeatureUnion([('numeric', numeric_pipeline), ('text', text_pipeline)])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Putting it all together**: Here's our entire pipeline, which processes our text and numeric data. First, we create our separate text and numeric pipelines. Remember, `get_numeric_data` and `get_text_data` are the `FunctionTransformers` that we just created. These pipelines output our numeric features and our text features respectively. Then we create our overall pipeline, which has two steps: First, the `FeatureUnion` takes a list of objects, calls each one, and then concatenates the output into a wide array out of all the results. In this case, it will call our numeric pipeline and then our text pipeline. Once we have this array of all of our features, we can pass it to our classifier. We can call fit and score on this pipeline, just like our simpler ones before it.\n",

    "3. Learning from the expert: text preprocessing: In our introduction to natural language processing, we introduced the same tools that the winner used. These are common tools for manipulating text, and are often effective for improving models based on text data. The first trick the winner used was to tokenize on punctuation. By noticing that there are lots of characters like hyphens, periods, and underscores in the text we are working with, the winner picked out a better way of separating words than just spaces. The other trick was to use a range of n-grams in the model. By including unigrams and bigrams, the winner was more likely to capture important information that appears as multiple tokens in the text--for example, \"middle school.\"\n",

    "4. N-grams and tokenization: One of the massive benefits of building our models on top of scikit-learn is that many of these common tools are implemented for us and are well-tested by a large community. To change our tokenization and add bi-grams, we can change our call to `CountVectorizer`. We'll pass the regular expression to only accept alphanumeric characters in our tokens. We defined this expression back in chapter 2. We'll also add the parameter `ngram_range` equals (1, 2). This tells the `CountVectorizer` to include 1-grams and 2-grams in the vectorization. These changes to the call to `CountVectorizer` are the only changes we need to make to add these preprocessing steps. We can easily update our pipeline to include this change, which will be part of the exercises.\n",

However, what if terms are not next to each other? For example, consider \"English Teacher for 2nd Grade\" and \"2nd Grade - budget for English Teacher\". If I want to identify this line item as a staff position for an elementary school, it helps to know that both \"2nd grade\" and \"English teacher\" appear. Interaction terms let us mathematically describe when tokens appear together.\n",

This new column, X3, has its own coefficient, Beta 3, which can separately measure how important it is that X1 and X2 appear together. Again,\n",
    "- ![][sb2]\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Adding interaction features with scikit-learn**: scikit-learn provides us with a straightforward way of adding interaction terms. In scikit-learn this functionality is called `PolynomialFeatures`, and we import it from the sklearn dot preprocessing module. As an example, we'll show the same x matrix as the last slide. When we create a `PolynomialFeatures` we tell it the degree of features to include. In our example, we looked at multiplying 2 columns together to see if they co-occurred, so degree equals 2, however, you could 3, 4, or more. While this can sometimes improve the model results, adding larger degrees very quickly scales the number of features outside what is computationally feasible. The `interaction_only` equals True parameter tells `PolynomialFeatures` that we don't need to multiply a column by itself, and we'll talk about include_bias on the next slide. When we fit and transform our array, x, we can see that we get the expected output from the last slide with the new column added. We opted not to include a bias term in our model, but you could have if you wanted to. A bias term is an offset for a model.\n",
    "```python\n",

    "       [1., 1., 1.]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "8. **A note about bias terms**: For example, if we plot age on the x-axis, and weights on the y-axis, we'd have a line that had a value 7-point-5 lbs when the baby is born, because a baby has a weight even when it is 0 years old! A bias term allows your model to account for situations where an x value of 0 should have a y value that is not 0, like in this example.\n",
    "- Bias term allows your model to have non-zero y value when x is 0\n",
    "- ![][sb3]\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Sparse interaction features**: As we mentioned, adding interaction terms makes your X array grow exponentially. Because of computational concerns, our `CountVectorizer` returns an object called a sparse matrix. We won't dig into the details here, but the standard `PolynomialFeatures` object is not compatible with a sparse matrix. We provide you with a replacement, `SparseInteractions` which works with a sparse matrix. You only need to pass it the `degree` parameter for it to work in the same way.\n",

    "1. Learning from the expert: the winning model: Congratulations! You've implemented nearly all of the winning pipeline. Just a couple more tweaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Learning from the expert: hashing trick: We've mentioned that we need to balance adding new features with the computational cost of additional columns. For example, adding 3-grams or 4-grams is going to have an enormous increase in the size of the array. As the array grows in size, we need more computational power to fit our model. The \"hashing trick\" is a way of limiting the size of the matrix that we create without sacrificing too much model accuracy. A hash function takes an input, in this case a token, and outputs a hash value. For example, the hash value may be an integer like in this example below. We explicitly state how many possible outputs the hashing function may have. For example, we may say that we will only have 250 outputs of the hash function. The `HashingVectorizer` then maps every token to one of those 250 columns. Some columns will have multiple tokens that map to them. Interestingly, the original paper about the hashing function demonstrates that even if two tokens hash to the same value, there is very little effect on model accuracy in real world problems.\n",

    "- Hashing is a way of increasing memory efficiency\n",
    "  - ![][sb4]\n",
    "- Hash function limits possible outputs, fixing array size\n",
    "3. When to use the hashing trick: We've been working with a small subset of the data for this course, however, the size of the full dataset is part of the challenge. In this situation, we want to do whatever we can to make our array of features smaller. Doing so is called \"**dimensionality reduction**\". The hashing trick is particularly useful in cases like this where we have a very large amount of text data.\n",
    "- Want to make array of features as small as possible\n",
    "  - Dimensionality reduction\n",
    "  - Particularly useful on large datasets\n",
    "  - e.g., lots of text data!\n",
    "4. Implementing the hashing trick in scikit-learn: Implementing the hashing trick is very simple in scikit-learn. Instead of using the `CountVectorizer`, which creates the bag of words representation, we change to the `HashingVectorizer`. We can pass this the same `token_pattern` and `ngram_range` as before. The parameters norm equals None and non_negative equals `True` let you drop in the `HashingVectorizer` as a replacement for the `CountVectorizer`. For more details on those two parameters, you can see the scikit-learn documentation. We can now use the `HashingVectorizer` in a `Pipeline` instead of the `CountVectorizer`.\n",

The NLP trick was to use bigrams and tokenize on punctuation. The statistical trick was to add interaction terms to the model. The computational trick was to use a `HashingVectorizer`. You can now code all of these in a scikit-learn Pipeline. However, there's one thing we haven't talked about yet. What is the class of model that the winner used? Was it a deep convolutional neural network? Extreme gradient boosted trees? An ensemble of local-expert elastic net regressions?\n",

    "6. The model that won it all: No! The winning model was, in fact, the simple model we started with: **logistic regression**! The competition wasn't won by a cutting edge algorithm. Instead, it was won by thinking carefully about how to create features for the model and then adding a couple of easily implemented tricks. So, instead of reaching for those advanced algorithms that are hard to interpret and expensive to train, it's always worth it to see how far you can get with simpler methods.\n",

    "In the video, Peter explained that a [hash][1] function takes an input, in your case a token, and outputs a hash value. For example, the input may be a string and the hash value may be an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've loaded a familiar python datatype, a dictionary called `hash_dict`, that makes this mapping concept a bit more explicit. In fact, [python dictionaries ARE hash tables][2]!\n",

We've successively added small code changes that have had a big effect on our model. Now we want you to think about how you might improve things. Some areas to look at might be: Including stemming or stop-word removal in your natural language processing. Trying a different class of model like RandomForest, KNN or Naive Bayes. Doing further processing on the numeric columns and handling NaNs differently than the default Imputer. One of the benefits of scikit-learn is GridSearch (as you learned about in the supervised learning course). Check out the scikit-learn documentation to see how to perform grid search over every object in a Pipeline. You could even look around the scikit-learn docs and experiment with a new technique you haven't used before. Feel free to sign up on DrivenData and experiment with some of these methods on the full dataset. Learning how these approaches effect real-world data can be a huge boost to your skills.\n",
