    "1. Imagine you work for a bank\n",
    "   - Imagine you work for a bank, and you need to build a model predicting how many transactions each customer will make next year. You have predictive data or features like: \n",
    "1. Example as seen by linear regression\n",
    "   - each customerâ€™s age,\n",
    "   - bank balance,\n",
    "   - whether they are retired, and so on. \n",
    "   - We'll get to deep learning in a moment, but for comparison, consider how a simple linear regression model works for this problem.\n",
    "   - The linear regression embeds an assumption that the outcome, in this case how many transactions a user makes, is the sum of individual parts.\n",
    "   - It starts by saying, \"what is the average?\" \n",
    "   - Then it adds the effect of age.\n",
    "   - Then the effect of bank balance. And so on.\n",
    "   - ![][1]\n",
    "   - So the linear regression model isn't identifying the interactions between these parts, and how they affect banking activity.\n",
    "   - Say we plot predictions from this model.\n",
    "   - We draw one line with the predictions for retired people, and another with the predictions for those still working.\n",
    "   - We put current bank balance on the horizontal axis, and the vertical axis is the predicted number of transactions.\n",
    "   - The left graph shows predictions from a model with no interactions.\n",
    "   - In that model we simply add up the effect of the retirement status, and current bank balance.\n",
    "   - The lack of interactions is reflected by both lines being parallel.\n",
    "   - That's probably unrealistic, but it's an assumption of the linear regression model.\n",
    "   - The graph on the right shows the predictions from a model that allows interactions, and the lines don't need to be parallel.\n",
    "   - ![][2]\n",
    "1. Interactions\n",
    "   - Neural networks are a powerful modeling approach that accounts for interactions like this especially well.\n",
    "   - Deep learning, the focus of this course, is the use of especially powerful neural networks.\n",
    "   - Because deep learning models account for these types of interactions so well, they perform great on most prediction problems you've seen before.\n",
    "   - But their ability to capture extremely complex interactions also allow them to do amazing things with text, images, videos, audio, source code and almost anything else you could imagine doing data science with.\n",
    "1. Course structure\n",
    "   - The first two chapters of this course focus on conceptual knowledge about deep learning.\n",
    "   - This part will be hard, but it will prepare you to debug and tune deep learning models on conventional prediction problems, and it will lay the foundation for progressing towards those new and exciting applications.\n",
    "   - You'll see this pay off in the third and fourth chapter.\n",
    "1. Build and tune deep learning models using keras\n",
    "   - You will write code that looks like this, to build and tune deep learning models using keras, to solve many of the same modeling problems you might have previously solved with scikit-learn.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "from keras.layers import Dense\n",
    "from keras.models import Sequential\n",
    "predictors = np.loadtxt('predictors_data.csv', delimiter=',')\n",
    "n_cols = predictors.shape[1]\n",
    "model = Sequential()\n",
    "model.add(Dense(100, activation='relu', input_shape = (n_cols,)))\n",
    "model.add(Dense(100, activation='relu'))\n",
    "model.add(Dense(1))\n",
    "```\n",
    "   - As a start to how deep learning models capture interactions and achieve these amazing results, we'll modify the diagram you saw a moment ago.\n",
    "1. Deep learning models capture interactions\n",
    "   - Here there is an interaction between retirement status and bank balance.\n",
    "   - Instead of having them separately affect the outcome, we calculate a function of these variables that accounts for their interaction, and use that to predict the outcome.\n",
    "   - Even this graphic oversimplifies reality, where most things interact with each in some way, and real neural network models account for far more interactions.\n",
    "   - So the diagram for a simple neural network looks like this.\n",
    "   - ![][3]\n",
    "1. Interactions in neural network\n",
    "   - On the far left, we have something called an input layer. This represents our predictive features like age or income.\n",
    "   - On the far right we have the output layer. The prediction from our model, in this case, the predicted number of transactions.\n",
    "   - All layers that are not the input or output layers are called hidden layers.\n",
    "   - They are called hidden layers because, while the inputs and outputs correspond to visible things that happened in the world, and they can be stored as data, the values in the hidden layer aren't something we have data about, or anything we observe directly from the world.\n",
    "   - Nevertheless, each dot, called a node, in the hidden layer, represents an aggregation of information from our input data, and each node adds to the model's ability to capture interactions.\n",
    "   - So the more nodes we have, the more interactions we can capture.\n",

    "## Forward propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weâ€™ll start by showing how neural networks use data to make predictions. This is called the forward propagation algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bank transactions example\n",
    "   - Let's revisit our example predicting how many transactions a user will make at our bank.\n",
    "   - For simplicity, we'll make predictions based on only the number of children and number of existing accounts.\n",
    "1. Forward propagation\n",
    "   - This graph shows a customer with two children and three accounts.\n",
    "   - The forward-propagation algorithm will pass this information through the network to make a prediction in the output layer.\n",
    "   - Lines connect the inputs to the hidden layer.\n",
    "   - Each line has a weight indicating how strongly that input effects the hidden node that the line ends at.\n",
    "   - These are the first set of weights.\n",
    "   - We have one weight from the top input into the top node of the layer, and one weight from the bottom input to the top node of the hidden layer.\n",
    "   - These weights are the parameters we train or change when we fit a neural network to data, so these weights will be a focus throughout this course.\n",
    "   - To make predictions for the top node of the hidden layer, we take the value of each node in the input layer, multiply it by the weight that ends at that node, and then sum up all the values.\n",
    "   - In this case, we get (2 times 1) plus (3 times 1), which is 5.\n",
    "   - Now do the same to fill in the value of this node on the bottom.\n",
    "   - That is (two times (minus one)) plus (three times one).\n",
    "   - That's one.\n",
    "   - Finally, repeat this process for the next layer, which is the output layer.\n",
    "   - That is (five times two) plus (one times -1).\n",
    "   - That gives an output of 9.\n",
    "   - We predicted nine transactions.\n",
    "   - ![][1]\n",
    "   - That's forward-propagation.\n",
    "   - We moved from the inputs on the left, to the hidden layer in the middle, and then from the hidden layers to the output on the right.\n",
    "   - ![][2]\n",
    "   - ![][3]\n",
    "   - ![][4]\n",
    "   - We always use that same multiply then add process.\n",
    "   - **If you're familiar with vector algebra or linear algebra, that operation is a dot product.**\n",
    "   - If you don't know about dot products, that's fine too.\n",
    "   - That was forward propagation for a single data point.\n",
    "   - In general, we do forward propagation for one data point at a time.\n",
    "   - The value in that last layer is the model's prediction for that data point.\n",
    "1. Forward propagation code\n",
    "   - Let's see the code for this.\n",
    "   - We import Numpy for some of the mathematical operations.\n",
    "   - We've stored the input data as an array. We then have weights into each node in the hidden layer and to the output.\n",
    "   - We store the weights going into each node as an array, and we use a dictionary to store those arrays.\n",
    "   - Letâ€™s start forward propagating. We fill in the top hidden node here, which is called node zero.\n",
    "   - We multiply the inputs by the weights for that node, and then sum both of those terms together.\n",
    "   - Notice that we had two weights for node_0. That matches the two items in the array it is multiplied by, which is the input_data.\n",
    "   - These get converted to a single number by the sum function at the end of the line.\n",
    "   - We then do the same thing for the bottom node of the hidden layer, which is called node 1.\n",
    "   - Now, both node zero and node one have numeric values.\n",
    "1. Forward propagation code\n",
    "   - To simplify multiplication, we put those in an array here.\n",
    "   - If we print out the array, we confirm that those are the values from the hidden layer you saw a moment ago.\n",
    "   - It can also be instructive to verify this by hand with pen and paper.\n",
    "   - To get the output, we multiply the values in the hidden layer by the weights for the output.\n",
    "   - Summing those together gives us 10 minus 1, which is 9.\n",

    "   - Then we make a prediction based on the outputs of hidden layer two.\n",
    "   - ![][4]\n",
    "   - In practice, it's becoming common to have neural networks that have many, many layers; five layers, ten layers.\n",
    "   - A few years ago 15 layers was state of the art but this can scale quite naturally to even a thousand layers.\n",
    "   - You use the same forward propagation process, but you apply that iterative process more times.\n",
    "   - ![][5]\n",
    "   - Let's walk through the first steps of that.\n",
    "   - Assume all layers here use the ReLU activation function.\n",
    "   - We'll start by filling in the top node of the first hidden layer.\n",
    "   - ![][6]\n",
    "   - That will use these two weights.\n",

    "   - And they find increasingly complex patterns as we go through successive hidden layers of the network.\n",
    "   - In this way, neural networks partially replace the need for feature engineering, or manually creating better predictive features.\n",
    "   - Deep learning is also sometimes called representation learning, because subsequent layers build increasingly sophisticated representations of the raw data, until we get to a stage where we can make predictions.\n",
    "   - This is easiest to understand from an application to images, which you will see later in this course.\n",
    "   - Even if you haven't worked with images, you may find it useful to think through this example heuristically.\n",
    "   - ![][15]\n",
    "1. Representation learning\n",
    "   - When a neural network tries to classify an image, the first hidden layers build up patterns or interactions that are conceptually simple.\n",
    "   - A simple interaction would look at groups of nearby pixels and find patterns like diagonal lines, horizontal lines, vertical lines, blurry areas, etc.\n",
    "   - Once the network has identified where there are diagonal lines and horizontal lines and vertical lines, subsequent layers combine that information to find larger patterns, like big squares.\n",
    "   - A later layer might put together the location of squares and other geometric shapes to identify a checkerboard pattern, a face, a car, or whatever is in the image.\n",
    "   - The cool thing about deep learning is that the modeler doesn't need to specify those interactions.\n",
    "1. Deep learning\n",
    "   - We never tell the model to look for diagonal lines.\n",
    "   - Instead, when you train the model, which you'll learn to do in the next chapter, the network gets weights that find the relevant patterns to make better predictions.\n",
    "   - Working with images may still seem abstract, but this idea of finding increasingly complex or abstract patterns is a recurring theme when people talk about deep learning, and it will feel more concrete as you work with these networks more.\n",

    "   - We'll use a simple example for the sake of explanation.\n",
    "   - For the moment, we won't use an activation function in this example, or if you prefer, you might think of an activation function that returns the input, sometimes called the identity function.\n",
    "   - We have values of 2 and 3 for the inputs, and the true value of the target is 13.\n",
    "   - So, the closer our prediction is to 13, the more accurate this model is for this data point.\n",
    "   - We use forward propagation to fill in the values of hidden layer.\n",
    "   - That gives us hidden node values of 5 and 1.\n",
    "   - Continuing forward propagation, we use those hidden node values to make a prediction of 9.\n",
    "   - Since the true target value is 13, our error is 13 minus 9, which is 4.\n",
    "   - ![][1]\n",
    "   - Changing any weight will change our prediction.\n",
    "   - Let's see what happens if we change the two weights from the hidden layer to the output.\n",
    "   - In this case, we make the top weight 3 and the bottom weight -2.\n",
    "   - Now forward propagation gives us a prediction of 13.\n",

    "1. Optimizing a model with a single weight \n",
    "   - Let's look at optimizing a model with a single weight, and then we'll scale up to optimizing multiple weights.\n",
    "   - We have a curve showing the loss function on the vertical axis, at different values of the weight, which is on the horizontal axis.\n",
    "   - We are looking for the low point on this curve, because that means our model is as accurate as possible.\n",
    "   - We have drawn this tangent line to the curve at our current point.\n",
    "   - The slope of that tangent line captures the slope of the loss function at the our current weight.\n",
    "   - That slope corresponds to something called the derivative from calculus. We use this slope to decide what direction we step.\n",
    "   - In this case, the slope is positive.\n",
    "   - So if we want to go downhill, we go in the direction opposite the slope, towards lower numbers.\n",

    "   - In the big picture, we are trying to estimate the slope of the loss function with respect to each weight in our network.\n",
    "   - You've already seen that we use prediction errors to calculate some of those slopes.\n",

    "   - We need to be at this step before we can start back-propagation.\n",
    "   - Notice, we are using the \"relu\" activation function.\n",
    "     - So any node whose input is negative takes a value of 0, and that happens in the top node of the first hidden layer.\n",
    "   - For back-propagation, we go back one layer at a time, and each time we go back a layer, we'll use a formula for slopes that you saw in the last video.\n",
    "   - Every weight feeds from some input node into some output node.\n",
    "   - The three things we multiply to get the slope for that weight are\n",
    "      1. the value at the weights input node\n",
    "      1. the slope from plotting the loss function against that weight's output node\n",
    "      1. the slope of the activation function at the weight's output.\n",
    "   - We know the value at the node feeding into this weight.\n",
    "   - Either it is in an input layer, in which case we have it from the data. Or that node is in a hidden layer, in which case we calculated its value when we did forward propagation.\n",

    "   - We do backward propagation from the right side of our diagram to the left.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Model building steps\n",
    "The Keras workflow has 4 steps. First, you specify the architecture, which is things like: how many layers do you want? how many nodes in each layer? What activation function do you want to use in each layer? Next, you compile the model. This specifies the loss function, and some details about how optimization works. Then you fit the model. Which is that cycle of back-propagation and optimization of model weights with your data. And finally you will want to use your model to make predictions. We'll go through these steps sequentially. The first step is creating or specifying your model.\n",

    "    - Compile\n",
    "    - Fit\n",
    "    - Predict\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model specification\n",
    "Here is the code to do that. This code has three blocks. First we import what we will need. Numpy is here only for reading some data. The other two imports are used for building our model. The second block of two lines reads the data. We read the data here so we can find the number of nodes in the input layer. That is stored as the variable n_cols. We always need to specify how many columns are in the input when building a keras model, because that is the number of nodes in the input layer. We then start building the model. The first line of model specification is model equals Sequential. There are two ways to build up a model, and we will focus on sequential, which is the easier way to build a model. Sequential models require that each layer has weights or connections only to the one layer coming directly after it in the network diagram. There are more exotic models out there with complex patterns of connections, but Sequential will do the trick for everything we need here. We start adding layers using the add method of the model. he type of layer you have seen, that standard layer type, is called a Dense layer. It is called Dense because all of the nodes in the previous layer connect to all of the nodes in the current layer. As you advance in deep learning, you may start using layers that aren't Dense. In each layer, we specify the number of nodes as the first positional argument, and the activation function we want to use in that layer using the keyword argument activation. Keras supports every activation function you will want in practice. In the first layer, we need to specify input shapes as shown here. That says the input will have n_cols columns, and there is nothing after the comma, meaning it can have any number of rows, that is, any number of data points. You'll notice the last layer has 1 node. That is the output layer, and it matches those diagrams where we ended with only a single node as the output or prediction of the model. This model has 2 hidden layers, and an output layer. You may be struck that each hidden layers has 100 nodes. Keras and TensorFlow do the math for us, so don't feel afraid to use much bigger networks than we've seen before. It's quite common to use 100 or 1000s nodes in a layer. You'll learn more about choosing an appropriate number of nodes later.\n",

In practice, the right choice of learning rate can make a big difference for how quickly our model finds good weights, and even how good a set of weights it can find. There are a few algorithms that automatically tune the learning rate. Even many experts in the field don't know all the details of all the optimization algorithms. So the pragmatic approach is to choose a versatile algorithm and use that for most problems. Adam is an excellent choice as your go-to optimizer. Adam adjusts the learning rate as it does gradient descent, to ensure reasonable values throughout the weight optimization process. The second thing you specify is the loss function. Mean squared error is the most common choice for regression problems. When we use keras for classification, you will learn a new default metric.\n",

Even with the Adam optimizer, which is pretty smart, it can improve your optimization process if you scale all the data so each feature is, on average, about similar sized values. One common approach is to subtract each feature by that features mean, and divide it by it's standard deviation.\n",

This isn't the only possible loss function for classification problems, but it is by far the most common. You may have heard of this before under the name LogLoss. We won't go into the mathematics of categorical crossentropy here. For categorical crossentropy loss function, a lower score is better. But it's still hard to interpret. So I've added this argument \"metrics equals accuracy\". This means I want to print out the accuracy score at the end of each epoch, which makes it easier to see and understand the models progress. Second you need to modify the last layer, so it has a separate node for each potential outcome. You will also change the activation function to softmax. The softmax activation function ensures the predictions sum to 1, so they can be interpreted like probabilities.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Why optimization is hard\n",
    "In practice, optimization is a hard problem. The optimal value for any one weight depends on the values of the other weights, and we are optimizing many weights at once. Even if the slope tells us which weights to increase, and which to decrease, our updates may not improve our model meaningfully. A small learning rate might cause us to make such small updates to the model's weights that our model doesn't improve materially. A very large learning rate might take us too far in the direction that seemed good. A smart optimizer like Adam helps, but optimization problems can still occur. The easiest way to see the effect of different learning rates is to use the simplest optimizer,\n",
    "  - Simultaneously optimizing 1000s of parameters with complex relationships\n",
    "  - Updates may not improve model meaningfully\n",
    "  - Updates too small (if learning rate is slow) or too large (if learning rate is high)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Stochastic gradient descent\n",
    "_Stochastic Gradient Descent_, sometimes abbreviated to _SGD_. This optimizer uses a fixed learning rate. Learning rates around point-01 are common. But you can specify the learning rate you need with `lr` argument as shown here. We have a function that creates a new model here. We create models in a for loop, and each time around we compile the model using SGD with a different learning rate. We pass in the optimizer with the same argument where we previously passed the string for \"Adam\". In an exercise, you will compare the results of training models trained with low, medium and high learning rates. Even if your learning rate is well tuned, you can run into the so-called\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The dying neuron problem\n",
    "\"dying-neuron\" problem. This problem occurs when a neuron takes a value less than 0 for all rows of your data. Recall that, with the ReLU activation function, any node with a negative input value produces an output of 0, and it also has a slope of 0 as you see in this graph. Because the slope is 0, the slope of any weights flowing into that node are also 0. So those weights don't get updated. In other words, once the node starts always getting negative inputs, it may continue only getting negative inputs. It's contributing nothing to the model at this point, and hence the claim that the node or neuron is \"dead.\" At first, this might suggest using an activation function whose slope is never exactly zero. However, those types of functions were used for many years.\n",
    "  - ![][1]\n",

    "5. Vanishing gradients\n",
    "For example, in an earlier video we used an s-shaped function called tanh. However, values that were outside the middle of the S were\n",
    "  - ![][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Vanishing gradients\n",
    "relatively flat, or had small slopes. A small but non-zero slope might work in a network with only a few hidden layers. But in a deep network, one with many layers, the repeated multiplication of small slopes causes the slopes to get close to 0, which meant updates in backprop were close to 0. This is called the vanishing gradient problem. This in turn might suggest using an activation function that isn't even close to flat anywhere. There is research in this area, including variations on ReLU. Those aren't widely used though. For now, it's a phenomenon worth keeping in mind if you are ever pondering why your model isn't training better. If it happens, changing the activation function may be the solution.\n",

We then create an \"early stopping monitor\" before fitting the model. That monitor takes an argument called patience, which is how many epochs the model can go without improving before we stop training. 2 or 3 are reasonable values for patience. Sometimes you'll get a single epoch with no improvement, but the model will start improving again after that epoch. But if you see 3 epochs with no improvement, it's unlikely to turn around and start improving again. We pass early_stopping_monitor to the fit function under an argument called callbacks. Notice that callbacks takes a list. You may consider adding other callbacks as you become very advanced. But early stopping is all you want for now. By default, keras trains for 10 epochs. Now that we have smart logic for determining when to stop, we can set a high maximum number of epochs. This happens with the nb_epoch argument, as you see here. Keras will go until this number of epochs, unless the validation loss stops improving, in which case it will stop earlier.

    "## Thinking about model capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At this point, you know how to run experiments, and compare different models performance. However, it takes some practice to get an intuition for what experiments or architectures to try. There is still a little more art to finding good deep learning architectures than there is for tuning other machine learning algorithms. But something called \"model capacity\" should be one of the key considerations you think about when deciding what models to try.\"Model capacity\" or \"network capacity\" is closely related to the terms overfitting and underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Overfitting\n",
    "You may recall overfitting and a graphic like this from a previous DataCamp course. Overfitting is the ability of a model to fit oddities in your training data that are there purely due to happenstance, and that won't apply in a new dataset.\n",
    "   - When you are overfitting, your model will make accurate predictions on training data, but it will make inaccurate predictions on validation data and new datasets.\n",
    "   - Underfitting is the opposite. That is when your model fails to find important predictive patterns in the training data. So it is accurate in neither the training data nor validation data.\n",
    "   - Because we want to do well on new datasets that weren't used for training the model, our validation score is the ultimate measure of a model's predictive quality.\n",
    "   - Let's get back to model capacity. Model capacity is a model's ability to capture predictive patterns in your data. So, the more capacity a model, the further to the right we will be on this graph. If you had a network, and you increased the number of nodes or neurons in a hidden layer, that would increase model capacity. And if you add layers, that increases capacity. Said another way, making larger layers or increasing the number of layers moves you further to the right of this graph. So, with that in mind,\n",
    "   - ![][61]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Workflow for optimizing model capacity\n",
    "here is a good workflow for you. Start with a simple network, and get the validation score. Then keep adding capacity as long as the score keeps improving. Once it stops improving, you can decrease capacity slightly, but you are probably near the ideal.\n",
    "   - Start with a small network\n",
    "   - Gradually increase capacity\n",
    "   - Keep increasing capacity until validation score is no longer improving\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Sequential experiments\n",
    "Let's walk through that process once. Here, I've started a model that has one hidden layer and 100 units. That's a relatively simple, or low capacity, model. I get a mean squared error\n",
    "   - ![][62]\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Sequential experiments\n",
    "of 5-point-4. Since I started with a simple model, I now try increasing capacity. I could increase the number of layers or use more hidden nodes. I'll start by using more nodes in the one hidden layer. That improved the model, so I'll keep increasing capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Sequential experiments\n",
    "This time I'll switch to using 2 hidden layers. Each layer has 250 nodes. That improved the error more. So, I try 3 layers, continuing to add capacity as long as it helps.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Sequential experiments\n",
    "This hurt the score. So, the model with 2 layers and 250 nodes is about perfect. I'll try another model that reduces capacity slightly from the last model I built.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Sequential experiments\n",
    "That is 3 hidden layers with 200 nodes each. That seems the best model yet. So I'll stick with that. Should you change capacity by adding layers or by adding nodes to an existing layer? There isn't a universal answer to that. You can experiment. But you should generally be thinking about whether you are trying to increase or decrease capacity, ideally honing in on the right capacity by looking at validation scores.\n",

There is an image of each handwritten digit, and each image is composed of a 28 pixel by 28 pixel grid. The image is represented by showing how dark each pixel is. So, 0 would be as light as possible, and 255 is as dark as possible. I've flattened the 28 x 28 grid for you into a 784 x 1 array for each image. Each image shows a digit like 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, all the way up to 9. Your model will predict which digit it is that was written. So you will create a deep learning model taking in those 784 features for each image as inputs, and predicting digits from among 10 possible values for the output."

    "1. Congrats. You are on your way to using the most fun and powerful modeling technique around.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next steps - There is still an immense amount to learn as you become a deep learning master. But it's like riding a bike. The hardest part is getting to the point where you can practice on your own, and you are there. You'll probably enjoy experimenting with deep learning using the same types of data you've used before for predictive modeling, tables of numeric data like what you commonly see in a pandas DataFrame or numpy array. From there, many people start working with images, using something called convolutional neural networks. But you could decide you want to focus on text. Or sound. Or you might get creative and apply deep learning to data others haven't even thought of. You'll find it's a powerful technique as you get the hang of it. Kaggle is a great place to find datasets to work with, and their forums are a great place to keep learning. As you get more advanced, start checking out the wikipedia page titled \"List of datasets for machine learning research.\" It includes datasets from some very interesting domains. Keras has excellent documentation. When there's something specific to look up, keras-dot-io is likely to have the answer. The keras and tensorflow repositories on github also have nice examples to work from. As you start working with larger datasets and more complex deep learning models, you may find these models can take a long time to fit. If you have a computer with a graphical processing unit, or GPU, you may be able to set up TensorFlow to use that GPU for computation. This generally requires a GPU that meets a standard called CUDA compatibility. Most GPU's made by NVIDIA are CUDA compatible. If you don't have a computer with a CUDA compatible GPU, here is a link with instructions about setting up a deep learning environment in the cloud that can run your models on a GPU. More than anything, share your work online, and have fun. If you keep experimenting and build out on the tools you've learned, you'll soon be amazed at what you can do.\n",
