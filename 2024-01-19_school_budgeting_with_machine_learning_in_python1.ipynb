    "\r\n",
    "1. **Pipelines, feature & text preprocessing**: You've submitted your first simple model. Now it's time to combine what we've learned about NLP with our model pipeline and incorporate the text data into our algorithm.\r\n",
    "- Repeatable way to go from raw data to trained model\r\n",
    "- Pipeline object takes sequential list of steps\r\n",

    "  - Transform: obj implementing .fit() and .transform()\r\n",
    "- Flexible: a step can itself be another pipeline!\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **The pipeline workflow**: The supervised learning course introduced pipelines, which are a repeatable way to go from raw data to a trained machine learning model. The scikit-learn Pipeline object takes a sequential list of steps where the output of one step is the input to the next. Each step is represented with a name for the step, that is simply a string, and an object that implements the fit and the transform methods. A good example is the `CountVectorizer` that we used earlier. As we'll see Pipelines are a very flexible way to represent your workflow. In fact, you can even have a sub-pipeline as one of the steps! The beauty of the Pipeline is that it encapsulates every transformation from raw data to a trained model.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "3. **Instantiate simple pipeline with one step**: After importing the relevant modules, we'll start with a one-step pipeline. Although we don't need a pipeline for a single step, this exercise will get us familiar with the syntax. Remember, we create a Pipeline by passing it a series of named steps. In this case the name is the string 'clf', and the step is the one-vs-rest logistic regression classifier we created earlier.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **Train and test with sample numeric data**: The sample dataset we've been working with has numeric data in the numeric columns and the with missing column. We'll start by building a model to predict the label column with the numeric data.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "5. **Train and test with sample numeric data**: First, we'll use the train_test split function from sklearn dot model_selection. Our X will just be the numeric column, and our Y will be the dummy encoding of the label column. We'll call the fit method on our Pipeline, just like a normal classifier in sklearn. We can see that it returns a Pipeline that has one step to do our logistic regression.\r\n",

    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",

    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",

To do so, we add a step to the Pipeline with the name 'imp' and an Imputer object. The default imputation in scikit-learn is to fill missing values with the mean of the column in question.

    "\r\n",
    "1. **Text features and feature unions**: In this video, we'll look at how we process text data in a pipeline and then how we put it all together.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Preprocessing text features**: Our sample dataframe contains one column we haven't used yet, the text column. First, we'll change our train and test data just to be working with the text data for now. Then, we'll add a step to our Pipeline with the name vec and the CountVectorizer object from scikit-learn. Now our pipeline will use the CountVectorizer on our dataset, and then it will pass the result into our classifier.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\r\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(sample_df['text'], pd.get_dummies(sample_df['label']), random_state=2)\r\n",

    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Preprocessing text features**: Again, we can call the fit and score methods on the Pipeline. The score function now reports our accuracy if we just use the text data.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "pl.fit(X_train, y_train)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "accuracy = pl.score(X_test, y_test)\r\n",
    "print('accuracy on sample data: ', accuracy)\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **Preprocessing multiple dtypes**: Let's say we want to use all of our data in a single pipeline. We can't just have a Pipeline that has a `CountVectorizer` step, Imputation step, and then a classifier. The `CountVectorizer` won't know what to do with the numeric columns, and we don't want to perform imputation on the text columns. In order to build our pipeline, we need to separately operate on the text columns and on the numeric columns. There are two tools: FunctionTransformer and FeatureUnion that will help us build a Pipeline to work with both our text and numeric data. The first utility that we cover is the FunctionTransformer.\r\n",
    "- Want to use all available features in one pipeline\r\n",
    "- Problem\r\n",
    "  - Pipeline steps for numeric and text preprocessing can't follow each other\r\n",
    "  - e.g., output of `CountVectorizer` can't be input to `Imputer`\r\n",
    "- Solution\r\n",
    "  - `FunctionTransformer()` & `FeatureUnion()`\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "5. **FunctionTransformer**: `FunctionTransformer` has a simple job: take a Python function, and turn it into an object that the scikit-learn Pipeline can understand. We'll write two simple functions: one that takes the whole dataframe, and returns just the numeric columns. The other will take the whole dataframe and return just the text columns. Using these function transformers, we can build a separate Pipeline for our numeric data and for our text data.\r\n",
    "- Turns a Python function into an object that a scikit-learn pipeline can understand\r\n",
    "- Need to write two functions for pipeline preprocessing\r\n",
    "  - Take entire DataFrame, return numeric columns\r\n",
    "  - Take entire DataFrame, return text columns\r\n",
    "- Can then preprocess numeric and text data in separate pipelines\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "6. **Putting it all together**: First, we'll do our train_test split on the entire dataset and import the FunctionTransformer and FeatureUnion utilities.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(sample_df[['numeric','with_missing', 'text']], pd.get_dummies(sample_df['label']), random_state=2)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import FunctionTransformer\r\n",
    "from sklearn.pipeline import FeatureUnion\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "7. **Putting it all together**: Next, we'll create two `FunctionTransformer` objects. The first takes a dataframe and just returns the column named 'text'. The second takes a dataframe and returns the columns named 'numeric' and 'with_missing'. These two function transformer objects will let us set up separate Pipelines that operate on the selected columns only. Note that we've passed the parameter validate equals False. This simply tells scikit-learn it doesn't need to check for NaNs or validate the dtypes of the input. We'll do that work ourselves.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "get_text_data = FunctionTransformer(lambda x: x['text'], validate=False)\r\n",
    "get_numeric_data = FunctionTransformer(lambda x: x[['numeric', 'with_missing']], validate=False)\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "8. **FeatureUnion Text and Numeric Features**: `FeatureUnion` from the sklearn dot pipeline module is the other utility we need. We know that our text pipeline generates the array on the left, our text features.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "9. **FeatureUnion Text and Numeric Features**: And our numeric pipeline generates the array on the right, our numeric features.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "10. **FeatureUnion Text and Numeric Features**: The FeatureUnion object puts these two sets of features together as a single array that will be the input to our classifier.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "from sklearn.pipeline import FeatureUnion\r\n",
    "union = FeatureUnion([('numeric', numeric_pipeline), ('text', text_pipeline)])\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "11. **Putting it all together**: Here's our entire pipeline, which processes our text and numeric data. First, we create our separate text and numeric pipelines. Remember, `get_numeric_data` and `get_text_data` are the `FunctionTransformers` that we just created. These pipelines output our numeric features and our text features respectively. Then we create our overall pipeline, which has two steps: First, the `FeatureUnion` takes a list of objects, calls each one, and then concatenates the output into a wide array out of all the results. In this case, it will call our numeric pipeline and then our text pipeline. Once we have this array of all of our features, we can pass it to our classifier. We can call fit and score on this pipeline, just like our simpler ones before it.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "numeric_pipeline = Pipeline([('selector', get_numeric_data), ('imputer', Imputer())])\r\n",

    "1. **Choosing a classification model**: Now that we understand how to pull together text and numeric data into a single machine learning pipeline, we'll return to talking about our school budget dataset. In the sample dataset, there was only one text column. This is the format that `CountVectorizer` expects.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Main dataset: lots of text**: However, our main dataset has 14 text columns. In an interactive exercise during our NLP chapter we wrote a function combine_text_columns that put together all the text columns into a single column. We'll re-use this function as part of our Pipeline to process the text in the budget dataset.\r\n",

For example, we could try a `RandomForestClassifier`, `NaiveBayesClassifier`, or a `KNeighborsClassifier` instead.

We simply import a different class of model--in this case, we'll use a `RandomForestClassifier`.
